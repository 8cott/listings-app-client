# Listings App - Client Side
[![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-Latest-blue)](https://reactjs.org/)
[![Vite](https://img.shields.io/badge/Vite-Latest-yellow)](https://vitejs.dev/)

This is the client-side of the Listings App, a full-stack application demonstrating proficiency in building a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack app with CRUD functionality. The app displays real estate listings from my career as a real estate broker and allows authenticated users to view, create, edit, update, and delete listings. Material-UI was used for the design.

## Live Demo
